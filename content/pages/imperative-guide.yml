  The imperative form is used for giving commands or requests. For simple verbs,
  the imperative is formed by using the verb stem for singular commands and
  adding "־ט" for plural commands. These are equivalent to the present tense for
  איך and איר.


  | Form     | Pronoun          | Example |

  | -------- | ---------------- | ------- |

  | singular | איך (I)          | רעד     |

  | plural   | איר (you plural) | רעדט    |


  There is only one exception to this rule: the verb "זיין" (to be). Its imperative forms are:


  | Form     | Pronoun          | Example |

  | -------- | ---------------- | ------- |

  | singular | איך (I)          | זײַ     |

  | plural   | איר (you plural) | זײַט    |


  Note that in Yiddish, the polite form of address uses the plural rather than singular form.


  ## Modal verbs


  Modal verbs do not have their own imperative forms.
