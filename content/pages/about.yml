title: About LoshnLab
slug: about
content: >-
  LoshnLab is a project dedicated to providing resources for learning and
  exploring the Yiddish language, with a focus on verbs and their various forms.
  It contains a searchable database of Yiddish verbs, conjugated for each tense,
  with transliterations and English meanings.


  Each of the verb pages are editable via a simple CMS interface, allowing users to contribute corrections or additional information to help improve the resource for everyone. At the moment, there are only a handful of verbs, so it would be great for users to add more verbs and their conjugations.


  The website is completely free to use and open source. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/agoldstone93/yiddish-language).
